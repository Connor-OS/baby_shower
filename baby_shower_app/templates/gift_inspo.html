    <p>
        Since many of you have expressed interest in knowing what would we wish for the baby shower as a
        gift, we created this website. Instead of acquiring unnecessary baby items, we&#39;ve collected here our
        wish list here to provide guidance on gifts that align with what we already have and what we&#39;d love
        to have. We&#39;re committed to maintaining an eco-friendly approach, so if you happen to have pre-
        loved items from the list feel free to gift it. We&#39;re more than happy with pre-owned baby items that
        have been well-cared for.
        Quick favour – if you happen to buy something from the list, shoot us a quick message via the
        website (little messaging box), so we can remove it from the list to avoid double-gifting shenanigans
    </p>

    <p>
        You can send your gift to the address:
        <br>
        <br><b>55 Sandringham Road</b>
        <br><b>Newcastle upon Tyne</b>
        <br><b>NE3 1QB</b>
        <br>
        <br>No pressure for gifting, this list is just a guide. We&#39;re beyond excited to see you in person and
        celebrate this unforgettable family milestone together.
    </p>

    <h2>REQUEST:</h2>
    <p>We&#39;re gearing up for some super fun games at the event and we have a little request. Could you
send us a picture of yourself when you were a tiny tot, preferably between 1-5 years old? We&#39;re
planning some games that will be extra special with these adorable pictures. Feel free to dig up
        those cute childhood pics and send them our way. It&#39;s going to be a blast!</p>
