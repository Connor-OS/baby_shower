        <h2>Gift ideas and guidance</h2>
        <p>
            Since many of you have expressed interest in knowing what would we wish for the baby shower as a
            gift, we created this website. Instead of acquiring unnecessary baby items, we&#39;ve collected here our
            wish list here to provide guidance on gifts that align with what we already have and what we&#39;d love
            to have. We&#39;re committed to maintaining an eco-friendly approach, so if you happen to have pre-
            loved items from the list feel free to gift it. We&#39;re more than happy with pre-owned baby items that
            have been well-cared for. <br>
            Quick favour – if you happen to buy something from the list, let us and others know
            using the "Tell us you're getting this gift button, to avoid double-gifting shenanigans
        </p>
    </div>
